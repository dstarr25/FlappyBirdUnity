# FlappyBirdUnity

This was the first every Unity project I created. It helped me get a basic 
understanding of the game engine and sparked my passion for Unity game development.

For this project, I tried to recreate flappy bird to feel exactly like the real game. 
All of the art is based on my computer science classroom and teacher in high school.
